# BDProject
# 
# Examination Project for the Big Data Science course. The project consists of two tasks (regression&classification). 
# Classification TASK: classify every possible mutation into active or inactive. The dataset contains 5409 numeric features extracted from biophysical models of 31270 mutant p53 proteins. These features represent 2D electrostatic and surface characteristics of molecules as well as 3D distances. 
# 
# Regression TAKS: data from 16 chemical sensors exposed to 6 gases at different concentration levels. The general purpose is to predict the concentration level of a gas given its feature values. There are several levels of difficulty for this task:
# 1) train a separate regression model for every gas
# 2) Train a single regression model to estimate the concentration of any gas
# 3) Train a single regression model to estimate the concentration of all 6 gases seperately
